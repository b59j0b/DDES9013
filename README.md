Assessment overview:
This assessment builds on knowledge gained in Assessment 1   and   requires you to produce a   range   of   design   solutions   for   a   prescribed   challenge   and   cultural   context. Your   final   project   will   demonstrate   a holistic   design   approach   that   addresses   the   needs   of   all   stakeholders   and   clearly   reflects   your   own   emerging values as a responsible design practitioner.   Feedback will be provided on   a   regular   basis   in tutorial/studio   through   discussion   with   peers   and   tutors. Summative   assessment   and   feedback   will   be provided   digitally   based   on   the   rubric.
Detailed assessment description:
This   individual   assessment   involves   completing   your   design   project   brief   from   Assessment   1 for   submission.
In   this   assessment   task   you   are   to   create   a   design   solution   in   response   to   the   self-initiated   design   brief   that was   submitted   for   Assessment   1. You   will   begin   the   task   by   building   a   contextual   background   for   the design project, which involves undertaking further research and analysis to better understand   the design opportunity and the socio-cultural context, stakeholders, and end users. You will document your progress   throughout   the   project   including   further   design   sketches, samples, experiments, sample   prototypes, and   final   designed   outcomes, to   build   a   process   journal   with   visual   and   textual   research   and   reflective   annotations.
There are two parts to complete: (1) a project presentation of a design solution (due Week   10);   and   (2)   a   completed   design   project   work, including   reflective   statement, process   journal   work, and   designed outcomes (due Week 11).
In the project presentation, you will outline the development of your design project work including research   and analysi代 写DDES9013 Assessment 2C/C++

Part 1:   Project Presentation
In Week 10 you will present a project presentation in the tutorial class. The project presentation must discuss   your   design   opportunity   and   take   us   through   the   steps   involved   in   the   completion   of   the   design   project   work   – from   research   to   initial   sketches   and   design   outcome(s). Explain   where   you   use   the   findings   from your research, and where possible tests with end users, to ensure your design is successful.
Remember that you should show your final   design clearly in the presentation. Ensure you include visual   examples   in   the   presentation, alongside   textual   information. Make   sure   to   link   the   images   to   your discussion   so   that   they   support   your   presentation.
Part 2: Design   Outcome
Your design outcomes should reference and respond to your design project brief research. You should   effectively   communicate   your   design   project   through   models, drawings, poster   and/or   visual   presentation,   and process   journal work. The context in which it is placed, seen or experienced   must   be   identified   as well   as the specific end user. Testing your ideas with your target audience or end user is highly   desirable,   and will   demonstrate   the   feasibility   of   your   design   project   in   a   real   world   context.
Submission requirements:
Part B   (Week   11)
What   to   submit: A   digitalised   version   of   your   design   project   work.
Your project work will include your process   journal work, in   a PDF document. You should include:   images of   your   final   design(s) along   with   images   of   your   supporting   creative   work   (sketches   / drawings   / models   /   objects as appropriate), your reflective comments, research (background on the problem, end   user, context,   precedents, etc), and a reference list. All sources must   be cited   using APA   Referencing   Style.
Due date:
•          Week 11   upload your file(s) to the Moodle folder   before   5pm   on the day of your class session.
