Assessment overview: This assessment requires you to work in groups to research and critically analyse a range   of precedents   which address contemporary design problems and stakeholder groups. Correctly referenced visual   and      written   analysis   is   required. Feedback   will   be   provided   on   a   regular   basis   in   tutorial/studio   through discussion   with   peers   and   tutors. Summative   assessment   and   feedback   will   be   provided   digitally   based   on   the   rubric. 
Detailed assessment description: 
This assessment has two parts: (A) Group Research   and   Presentation;   and   (B)   Individual   Design   Brief   and   Process Journal.
The   first   part   of   the   assessment   invites   you   to   work   in   groups   to   research   and   critically   analyse   two precedents   which   address   a   contemporary   design   challenge   that   your   group   will   select   from   the   prescribed   list   below   (refer   also   to   the   more   detailed   list   in   Moodle): 
1.       Circular   Design
2.       Design for Social   Impact
3.       Design   for   Accessibility
4.       Sustainable Fashion
5.         Design and   Health
6.         Eco-Design
The   second   part   of   the   assessment   involves   writing   an   individual   design   project   brief   for   a   project   (that   you will   complete   for   Assessment   2).
Steps to complete the assessment: 
Part A: Group Research Presentation 
For   the   first   part   of   the   assessment, you   will   work   within   a   small   team   of   3 to   prepare   a   research presentation   that   examines   a   design   challenge   within   two   different   socio-cultural   contexts. The   team   will   discuss and select the design challenge, gather and analyse research, make comparisons,   and   prepare   a      group   research   presentation   that   will   be   communicated   in   class. 
1.       Conduct group-initiated research into 2 case studies that have adopted   responses to your selected      design   challenge   but   in   different   socio-cultural   contexts   (e.g. a   western   and   a   non-western   context).   Your   case   studies   may   draw   from   socio-cultural   contexts   in   local   and   global   locations. Your presentation   should   form   a   comparative   analysis   of   your   two   precedents   covering   (1) cultural, social, behavioural, ethical, environmental, and sustainability issues; and (2) stakeholder perspectives and the design considerations utilised. It will be useful to refer to the UN Sustainable   Development Goals (SDGs) or other theoretical lenses to measure the effectiveness of your case         studies. 
2.      The presentation must include visual and written components and include a comprehensive reference   list   in   APA   style   format.
3.      The   responsibility   for   each   aspect   of   the   group   work   should   be   delegated   strategically   to   individual members   of   your   team   on   the   basis   of   their   nominated   area(s) of   disc代 写DDES9013 Assessment 1SQL

4.      The   presentation   will   conclude   with   a   brief   overview   of   your   individual   design   project   briefs   that   will be   completed   for   Assessment   2.
Part B: Design Proposal and Process Journal 
For   the   writing   of   the   design   project   brief, and   the   corresponding   process   journal   work, you   will   work individually.
1.       In this part of the assessment you will   apply your group research to the design challenge, relevant
cultural   considerations, stakeholders   and   end-users   in   a   specific   socio-cultural   context. Your   design   project brief should clearly specify and explain (1) the problem and design opportunity; the proposed context, stakeholders, and end user; (2) the design outcomes that you intend to create for   Assessment 2; and (3) a plan for how you will execute the work in the allocated timeframe. 
2.      You   will   need   to   provide   process   journal   work   to   demonstrate   the   direction   and   feasibility   of   your
project, which includes preliminary design work such as design ideas, sketches, and samples.
How to prepare the assessment: 
As a group create a visually and experientially coherent Group Research   Presentation that should   reflect   the analysis of your research, key findings, and a summary of the individual design   project   briefs. This should be timed to approx. 15 minutes and it will be presented in the tutorial group   session in   Week   5. A   PDF   version   of   the   presentation   (that   includes   the   verbal   script) must   be   submitted   to   Moodle   before   the   end of your class session.
As an individual create a PDF that includes: (1) the work you conducted for the group research presentation; (2) your   finalised   design   project   brief   (to   complete   for   Assessment   2), and   (3) the   process journal   work   that   evidences   a   reflective   approach   to   the   direction   and   feasibility   of   your   design   project   brief.
Submission requirements: 
1.       Group Research Presentation: Present your 15   minute   Research   Presentation   in the tutorial session.
2.       Upload   a   PDF   version   of   the   presentation   (which   shows   slides   and   text/script) to   Moodle   before   the   end of your class session. Please be aware of file size restrictions when uploading to Moodle.
3.       Individual Design project brief, process   journal work,   and team evaluation:   Include your finalised
individual   design   project   brief   and   corresponding   journal   process   work; and   include   journal   work   to demonstrate your contribution to the group research presentation. Upload a PDF copy to Moodle before the end of your class session. Please be aware of file size restrictions when uploading to Moodle. All sources must be cited using APA Referencing Style.
4.       Compile your group and individual work: Create ONE   PDF file containing your final   Group   Research Presentation and your Individual Design project brief, process   journal work, and team evaluation   and   upload to Moodle by the due date.
